Planning/Logic and resources:
I made this game with different categories. Users can choose the category that is of their grade. Each category includes grade appropriate questions.
I used HTML, JavaScript-API, Bootstrap, Google Fonts, Fonts Awesome, jQuery, Flask, CSS and Python. JS and jQuery were used for the API calling. Three API’s were implemented, one for category, another for questions and the third for the answers.
There is no sound effects.
